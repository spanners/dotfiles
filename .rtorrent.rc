# # Calculation:
#
# 1. Maximum upload speed
#
#     Use the following formula to determine your optimal upload speedâ€¦
#
#     80% of your maximum upload speed
# 
# 2. Maximum download speed
# 
#     95% of your maximum download speed
# 
# 3. Maximum connected peers per torrent
# 
#     upload speed * 1.3
# 
# 4. Maximum upload slots
# 
#     1 + (upload speed / 6)
